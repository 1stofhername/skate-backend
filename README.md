# Skate

A place for those who frequent skateparks to get information about who is at a skatepark at any given time.

## Description

Skate is an attempt to get away from the one-size-fits-all social media model that has been the only option for so long. Skate is designed to show just the information that skaters want to see, and to allow them to show where they are skating and what they are riding, and to view the same information about other riders or skate parks with varying levels of detail.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]. React-router-dom ensures snappy client side routing and minimizes server calls. This project also uses CSS styling to create a modern and responsive interface. Changes are persisted using a Sinatra API.

## Getting started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `bundle install`

Installs necessary dependencies.

### `bundle exec rake server`

Runs the server in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:9292] to view it in your browser.

### `bundle exec rake console`

Opens a console in the terminal window that can be used to interact with the database.
